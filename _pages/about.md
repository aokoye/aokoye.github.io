I am a linguist and writer based in Portland, Oregon. I graduated with a Masters in Bilingualism Studies from the University of Ottawa and have over 5 years of expierence working in linguistic research. Right now work as a Linguistic Analyist for Solventum and do freelance program evaluation and grant writing.

Currently I am a student in the University of Washington's [Certificate in Professional Technical Writing](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing). This portfolio will primarily showcase my technical writing projects.

When I'm not writing, you can find me spinning yarn, knitting, learning languages, trying new recipes, and running slowly around Portland and Seattle.
