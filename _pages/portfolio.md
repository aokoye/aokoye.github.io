[**Add Furigana to Flashcards in Anki**](/portfolio/anki/): This is a project that was created for the Foundations Of Professional Technical Writing class in the University of Washington's [Certificate in Professional Technical Writing](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing) program. It was created in reaction to the difficulty that many people who use the Anki application have in figuring out how to add furigana to flashcards.

[**Work Smart with Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lL1eya2ExqIiyktEa8ess9LYzUCPbS5tNVtqyblsGo/edit?usp=sharing): This is a Project that I completed for the Intermediate Professional Technical Writing class in the University of Washington's [Certificate in Professional Technical Writing](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing) program. I was in charge of all of the formatting and some of the editing for this project. Another member of my team did the writing and a third did most of the editing.
