My name is Adam and I am a writer and linguist based in the Pacific Northwest. This site will serve as somewhere to put my thoughts about writing (and language) as well as a portfolio for my technical writing. I may also put programming projects on here as well.

When I'm not writing I enjoy learning languages, baking, and fiber arts. I am also trying slowly getting back into running.
